# Marketing Ideas for Ill Advised

## The Pitch

**"Is your iPhone on its last legs? Send it out in a blaze of glory."**

Ill Advised is the ultimate novelty app for documenting your phone's spectacular demise. Record from both cameras with full telemetry data as you throw it, drop it, launch it, or creatively destroy your old device. Stream it live or save it locally (if it survives).

### Pitch to Press
```
Subject: App turns phone destruction into viral content with real-time telemetry

Hi [Name],

I've built an iOS app that does something ridiculous but technically impressive: 
it records your iPhone's own destruction with full sensor telemetry.

Ill Advised uses dual cameras to capture phone destruction (drops, throws, 
launches) while overlaying real-time GPS, altitude, speed, g-forces, and 
orientation data. Think GoPro meets "Will it blend?" meets data visualization.

The app is built for:
- Content creators making viral destruction videos
- People with old phones ready for disposal (why not make it entertaining?)
- Physics education (seriously - terminal velocity, impact forces, etc.)

I've created demo videos showing phones being [dropped from cliffs/run over/
launched] with full telemetry data captured. The results are oddly satisfying.

Would you be interested in covering it? I can provide:
- Review units (old iPhones for testing)
- Demo videos
- Technical details on how it works
- Interview about the engineering

The app launches [DATE] on the App Store.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```
