# The Philosophy Behind Ill Advised

## On Absurdity and Privilege

This app is absurd.

The idea of creating software specifically to document the intentional destruction of a valuable electronic device—one that costs hundreds or thousands of dollars, one that billions of people around the world cannot afford—is, on its face, ridiculous.

And that absurdity is the point.

## The Commentary

Ill Advised exists as a piece of social commentary on first-world consumption patterns. It highlights the stark contrast between:

**Those who have so much** that they can destroy expensive devices "for fun" or "for content"

**and**

**Those who have so little** that access to basic technology—a working phone, a computer, internet access—remains out of reach.

This gap is not just about wealth. It's about:
- **Educational opportunity** (digital literacy, access to information)
- **Economic mobility** (job applications, remote work, banking)
- **Social connection** (staying in touch with family, community)
- **Basic services** (healthcare, government services, emergency communication)

## The Digital Divide

According to various studies:
- **2.9 billion people** globally have never used the internet
- **Hundreds of millions of children** lack access to computers for remote learning
- **Low-income families** in developed nations often can't afford devices or internet
- **E-waste** amounts to over 50 million tons annually, while working devices sit unused in drawers

The ability to destroy a phone as entertainment is a privilege most of the world cannot fathom.

## Why Make This App?

You might ask: "If the premise is problematic, why create it at all?"

Several reasons:

### 1. **Awareness Through Satire**
Sometimes the best way to highlight an uncomfortable truth is through satire. By making the absurdity explicit, we force people to confront it. You can't use this app without acknowledging the privilege involved.

### 2. **Redirecting Consumption Toward Good**
People were going to destroy old phones anyway—for YouTube videos, TikTok content, or just cathartic release. By building this app, we can:
- Make that destruction more thoughtful
- Encourage donations to bridge the gap
- Turn wasteful behavior into charitable action

### 3. **Art as Social Commentary**
This is, in a sense, performance art. The app itself is a statement about consumption, waste, and inequality. It's meant to make you uncomfortable.

### 4. **Practical Harm Reduction**
If phones are being destroyed regardless, at least:
- Encourage proper e-waste disposal
- Promote donations to digital equity organizations
- Create awareness about technology access issues

## The Ask

**If you use this app, please donate.**

The app is free. There's no paywall, no ads, no in-app purchases. We don't profit from it.

But we ask that you pay anyway—not to us, but to organizations working to bridge the digital divide:

- **EveryoneOn** - Affordable internet for low-income families
- **PCs for People** - Refurbished computers for those in need
- **World Computer Exchange** - Technology for underserved communities globally
- **Computers With Causes** - Computers for families and students
- And many others...

**Consider it the real price of admission.**

The amount is up to you. Ideally:
- What you would have paid for a similar app ($5-20)
- Or a percentage of the value of the phone you're destroying (1-5%)
- Or whatever you can afford

## On E-Waste

Electronic waste is one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally. Phones contain:
- Precious metals (gold, silver, palladium)
- Rare earth elements
- Toxic materials (lead, mercury, cadmium)

**Before you destroy a phone:**
1. **Back up your data**
2. **Factory reset and wipe it**
3. **Remove SIM and SD cards**
4. **Consider:** Could this phone be donated instead?
5. **After destruction:** Properly recycle the remains

Many organizations accept old phones:
- Charity donation programs
- Cell phone recycling programs
- E-waste collection centers
- Manufacturer take-back programs

## On Creation vs. Destruction

There's something deeply human about the urge to destroy things. We've always been fascinated by:
- Demolition videos
- "Will it blend?" experiments
- Crash tests
- Drop tests

This app channels that impulse in a way that:
- Captures interesting data (physics, engineering)
- Creates shareable content (viral videos)
- Acknowledges the problematic nature (social consciousness)
- Encourages positive action (charitable giving)

## For Content Creators

If you're using this app to create videos:

### Consider Adding Context
In your video, mention:
- The phone was already broken/obsolete
- You're donating to digital equity charities
- The reality of global technology access inequality
- Where viewers can donate too

### Make It Educational
Use the sensor data to teach:
- Physics (terminal velocity, g-forces, impact)
- Technology (how sensors work)
- Social issues (digital divide, e-waste)

### Be Responsible
- Don't create dangerous content
- Don't encourage wasteful behavior
- Don't throw phones at people/animals
- Show proper e-waste disposal

## The Larger Questions

This app forces us to confront uncomfortable questions:

**Q: Is it ethical to destroy a working device?**
A: Probably not if someone else could use it. Donate working devices instead.

**Q: Is it ethical to destroy a broken device for entertainment?**
A: If it's truly e-waste and properly disposed of afterward, and you're acknowledging the privilege and donating, perhaps it's less harmful than simply discarding it.

**Q: Shouldn't we just not destroy phones at all?**
A: Ideally, yes. But if the alternative is doing it without thought or awareness, at least this approach adds consciousness to the act.

**Q: Isn't this just trying to justify wasteful behavior?**
A: Possibly. That's for you to decide. We're trying to add awareness and redirect toward good, but you have to live with your choices.

## On Privilege

If you're reading this, you likely have:
- A smartphone or computer
- Internet access
- Disposable income
- Free time for entertainment

These are privileges billions lack. This isn't meant to induce guilt, but awareness.

**What you do with that awareness is up to you.**

## The Hope

Our hope is that this app:

1. **Makes people think** about consumption and privilege
2. **Generates donations** for digital equity organizations
3. **Raises awareness** of technology access issues
4. **Encourages responsible** e-waste disposal
5. **Creates a moment** of reflection before destruction

If even 10% of users donate $10, and the app reaches 100,000 users, that's $100,000 for digital equity.

If it changes even a few minds about consumption and waste, it's worthwhile.

## For Reviewers and Press

When covering this app, please mention:

- The social consciousness component (not just the destruction aspect)
- The charity donation encouragement
- The commentary on first-world excess
- The proper e-waste disposal information
- That we don't profit from the app

This isn't just a "destroy your phone" app. It's a statement about inequality dressed up as entertainment.

## Final Thoughts

**We don't want you to destroy phones.**

We'd rather you:
- Donate working devices to those who need them
- Properly recycle broken ones
- Use your phones until they truly die
- Give to digital equity charities regardless

But if you're going to destroy a phone anyway—for content, catharsis, or curiosity—at least do it:
- **Thoughtfully** (acknowledging privilege)
- **Generously** (donating to those in need)
- **Responsibly** (proper e-waste disposal)
- **Safely** (not endangering others)

And maybe, just maybe, pause before you do it and ask yourself:

"Could this device do more good in someone else's hands?"
