Project Disclaimer: The Fine Print for Poor Decisions

We have built a digital tool to document your choice to destroy a piece of property. The developer is not a lawyer, a safety consultant, or your mother. Please read this carefully before proceeding with your personal experiment in consumer finality.

⚠️ WARNING: INHERENT RISK AND ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITY

THIS APPLICATION, "ILL ADVISED," IS INTENDED SOLELY FOR NOVELTY, ENTERTAINMENT, AND SOCIAL COMMENTARY. ANY USE OF THIS APP INVOLVING THE PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION OF A DEVICE CARRIES EXTREME AND INHERENT RISK.

By installing or using this application, you, the user, expressly acknowledge and accept the following without exception:

1. Total Assumption of Risk: You assume all risks associated with any activities you choose to document using this application. You understand that the objective is the permanent destruction of the device on which the application is running.
1. Zero Liability for Damages: The developer is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages whatsoever. This includes, but is not limited to, damage to property (other than the device being destroyed), environmental harm, personal injury, or sadly, death. Your actions are yours alone.
1. Data Loss is Guaranteed: You acknowledge that using this app as intended will result in the total and irrecoverable loss of the device and all data stored on it. You are solely responsible for backing up and securely wiping sensitive information before any destructive acts. We will not retrieve your tax returns.
1. Legal and Regulatory Compliance: You are responsible for adhering to all local, state, and national laws. This includes all regulations regarding e-waste disposal, public safety, and public nuisance. Do not throw phones at people, property, or into protected public waters. We are merely providing the stopwatch and sensor overlay.
1. No Professional Advice: This document is not legal advice, safety instruction, or professional guidance. If you are unsure about the safety or legality of your planned activity, consult a qualified professional before proceeding with your documented experiment.

In summary: The app records the final result of your own ill-advised choices. The developer cannot be held responsible for the consequences of those choices. Use only with a device you are 100% prepared to lose permanently.
